Day one, a brief and intuitive feeling: 

completely disconnecting from the internet is an overcorrection. （Especially when you're taking a poop (｡ì _ í｡)）

But the benefit is that you quickly become able to discern which pieces of the relentless stream of information bombarding you are truly necessary and important to you. 

The complex web of social interactions and the massive flow of information you passively received before are effortlessly deconstructed one by one.  

Also, I genuinely recommend that anyone who feels exhausted yet deeply dependent on the internet should try this for a few days.
