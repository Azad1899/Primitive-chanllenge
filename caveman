As you can see, this is a complete “caveman” challenge. 
  
With the rapid development of the internet era, advanced recommendation algorithms and social media platforms’ content streaming mechanisms have been bombarding me with massive amounts of information that I never intended to know. 

It’s hard to say this is entirely bad, but it’s equally difficult to call it a logical product of intuitive user interaction. 
  
I’ve realized that I’ve spent way too much time on this, and I think I need to stop and explore other aspects of the world.

Maybe one day, you’ll spot me squatting in a park somewhere, messing around with an ant nest! 

I understand that this challenge might not last too long—but maybe not too short, either. 
  
I just feel that, every now and then, we need to completely unplug for a while. I’ll regularly document my changes, thoughts, and everything I’ve overlooked in the past right here.

I love my friends. So, without further ado, let this challenge begin now! ^_^
